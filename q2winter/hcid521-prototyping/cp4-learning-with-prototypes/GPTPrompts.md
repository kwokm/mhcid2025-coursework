## Toys to Stories
Based on three pictures of toys uploaded into the chat, create a one-minute story featuring those toys as characters. The story should be engaging, imaginative, and suitable for children. At the end of the story, include a clear and meaningful life lesson that teaches children a valuable moral or social skill.

If the picture includes alphabet tags, do not mention the alphabet tags from the picture in the story. Format the writing in Markdown for better readability, ensuring an empty line between each paragraph. Use a subtitle only for the ‘Life Lessons’ section.
